## We all know .:TwoOrThree devs considering a job change.

We constantly display great opportunities for devs in the quest for a better career-path, a new challenging project or an important range/salary jump. 
Great salaries, great work environments and great bonuses. We only work with companies that compensate their employees in a fair wage and that are actively looking for ways to make their employees feel valued. Are you interested in making a career change or do you know someone looking for a job?


## A Referral Program built with developers in mind.
Coders are the star of our show. We’ve built a platform that helps shape the future of the ones in charge of shaping our future. 

- Refer and earn extra ca$h. We know you rock, and your friends do too. The core of our business is that we commission referrers that help their acquaintances land new roles.

If your friends don’t get hired we still want you to be part of our growth program.

- Follow our relevant content. We solve developers greatest problems for free.
- Take control of your professional improvement with access to online courses.

## Participate

```
Stakeholders
Referrer: professional that recommends a candidate for a specific position.
Candidate: professional that participates in the hiring process.
Company: organization that offers job positions.
New Employee: professional hired by a company.
```

- To participate in our Referral Program, you must refer a Candidate to one or more of our available positions.
- To earn a Referral Bonus, you must successfully refer a Candidate to a direct hire by a company.
- Referral Bonus will be paid to the Referrer when the new employee meets a 3 (three) month trial period.
- All referred Candidates will participate in the Companies’ in-house hiring process, so there is no assurance of a hire with the sole act of referring someone.
- You as a developer can directly apply to jobs as well, in fact, we encourage you to do so, however you are not eligible to earn a referral for your own position.
- There is no limit to references/applications. You can refer as many candidates as you like, to as many positions you like; but there’s no need to.
- We value accuracy the most (hired reference) and rank referrers based on metric.
- Referral bonuses are based on company-negotiated wages only.
